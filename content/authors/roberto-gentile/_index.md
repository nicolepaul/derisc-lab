I work in cutting-edge areas of civil engineering, including seismic risk assessment for design and rehabilitation, and catastrophe risk modelling. I develop advanced methodologies applicable for practicing engineers and risk models, contributing both to the state of the art and state of practice. I am currently a co-director of the DE|RISC Lab (Disaster Engineering for ResIlient SoCieties Laboratory), working at the intersection of civil engineering and other disciplines to facilitate multi-hazard risk- and resilience-informed decision-making for a better tomorrowâ€™s world.
