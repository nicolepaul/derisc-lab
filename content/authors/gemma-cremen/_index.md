My research lab at UCL develops innovative disaster-risk management tools, facilitating informed decision making for safer future societies. This work involves a significant interdisciplinary component; I enjoy collaborating with colleagues from across hazard science and social science, as well as in civil engineering.  I was previously a (Senior) Research Fellow (Civil Engineering) and a Research Associate (Geophysics) at UCL and the University of Bristol, respectively. 

I completed my Ph.D. in Earthquake Engineering at Stanford University, under the supervision of Prof. Jack Baker. My doctoral research involved using various statistical techniques to benchmark, validate, and improve loss predictions of performance-based earthquake engineering assessment procedures. Findings from this research can be found in [five journal papers](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/gemmacremen/publications?authuser=0). 

I have degrees in Civil Engineering from Stanford University (M.S. 2016, Ph.D. 2019) and University College Cork, Ireland (B.E. 2014 - first place). I also have related professional experience in Atkins, U.K.  My awards include the Stanford Graduate Fellowship, the John A. Blume Research Fellowship, and the University College Cork Science and Engineering Graduate of the Year Gold Medal.
