I am a Professor of Catastrophe Risk Engineering in the University College London (UCL)'s Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering (CEGE), UK, and a Visiting Professor at The University of British Columbia, Vancouver Campus, Canada, during my 12-month academic sabbatical from UCL. Before joining UCL, I worked as a Catastrophe Risk Modeler at Applied Insurance Research (AIR) Worldwide, San Francisco, USA, and as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Performance-based Earthquake Engineering Laboratory, at the University of California, Irvine, USA. I earned my PhD in Earthquake Risk at the Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy, in January 2011.


​My research focuses on developing and applying probabilistic and statistical methods and tools for catastrophe risk modeling and disaster risk reduction. I investigate risks to building portfolios and infrastructure exposed to multiple natural hazards, including earthquakes, strong wind, and flooding, with particular emphasis on community infrastructure (schools, hospitals, heritage assets) in developing countries.

I co-lead the DE|RISC Lab: Disaster Engineering for ResIlient SoCieties Laboratory at UCL with Dr Gemma Cremen and Dr Roberto Gentile, working at the intersection of civil engineering and other disciplines to facilitate multi-hazard risk- and resilience-informed decision-making for a better tomorrow’s world. Our ultimate goal is to provide society with a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable built environment.
