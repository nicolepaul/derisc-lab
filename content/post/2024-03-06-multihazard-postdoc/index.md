We are recruiting 2-3 Postdoctoral Research Fellows in Multi-hazard Risk and Urban Resilience Modelling to join the DE|RISC Lab (Disaster Engineering for ResIlient SoCieties Laboratory) at UCL. This opportunity is part of a new exciting £5M project titled ‘Mitigating Environmental Disruptive Events Using People-Centric Predictive Digital Technologies to Improve Disaster and Climate Resilience’ with 16 project partners across Europe and New Zealand.

The project aims to develop and implement a comprehensive, people-centered computational framework for forward-looking disaster risk quantification and reduction. This framework, along with its accompanying technology platform, will be used to design and test strategies that increase the resilience and sustainability of built environments exposed to hydrometeorological and climatological hazards.

We will be testing this framework across three demo sites in Dublin (IE), Patras (GR), and Wellington (NZ). These sites represent distinct climatic areas and present both common and unique environmental and societal challenges.

The positions will be available from 1st July 2024 with a competitive salary. The initial appointment will be for one year, with the possibility of extension for up to an additional year, subject to performance.

Essential requirements for the roles include:

- A PhD degree in Multi-Hazard Disaster Risk Engineering or a relevant subject area (e.g., Civil/Structural Engineering)

- Knowledge and experience in applying appropriate techniques/approaches for end-to-end disaster-related risk assessments and mitigation, with a particular emphasis on hydrometeorological and climatological hazards

- Knowledge and experience in Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) processes

- Experience with modeling coupled physical and social systems in the context of disaster-related risk

- Proficiency with R, Python, Matlab, and GIS tools

- A track record in publishing high-quality research

- Ability to work collaboratively in multi- and inter-disciplinary environments and teams

- Experience facilitating workshops and meetings

If you meet the key requirements mentioned above, we invite you to share your CV and discuss these positions further. Please reach out to us via email at g.cremen@ucl.ac.uk or c.galasso@ucl.ac.uk. Kindly note that we will only respond to inquiries that fulfill the specified requirements.
